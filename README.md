# CP1404 Practicals
Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## Student: Zhang Guoyang
This warehouse contains my practical homework in the CP1404 course, showing my exploration and practice in writing clean code. I am committed to writing high-quality and easy-to-maintain code and constantly improving my development skills.

### Clean Code Guide:
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
Avoid redundant code. Repeated calculations or conditions should be consolidated to reduce errors and improve clarity.

- Error Checking
Handle errors effectively by using loops or try-except blocks to catch invalid inputs and ensure smooth program flow.

- Anti-Patterns
Avoid common mistakes like using variables you donâ€™t need, redundant type conversions, and unnecessary loops
